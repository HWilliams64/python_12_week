    "# Understanding Access Modifiers in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Access modifiers (also known as access specifiers) are used in object-oriented programming to set the accessibility of classes, methods, and properties. They determine the scope of a variable, method, or class in a program. However, Python doesn't support true access modifiers in the same way that languages like Java or C++ do. Still, there are certain conventions in Python that offer similar functionality.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A leading single underscore (like `_var`) is a Python convention that indicates a name is meant for internal use. It's considered a \"weak\" internal use or private variable, method, or class — i.e., it should not be accessed directly.
