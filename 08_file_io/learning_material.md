# File Input/Output (I/O) in Python

Welcome to the File I/O in Python module! Throughout this module, you'll dive into the process of interacting with files on your system using Python, learning how to read from and write to text files, including those formatted as JSON and CSV. In Python, file handling is a critical aspect of many projects, whether you're building a simple script or a complex web application.

## Module Topics:

1. Reading and Writing to Text Files:
   - Understand the basic process of opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
   - Learn how to handle both plain text files and files with special formatting.
   - Explore different modes for file opening, such as read mode, write mode, and append mode.
   - Practice reading from and writing to files to solidify your understanding.

2. Efficient File Handling with Context Managers:
   - Discover the concept of context managers and how they make file handling more efficient.
   - Understand the importance of properly closing files after use, and how context managers simplify this.
   - Learn about the 'with' keyword and how it's used to implement context managers.
   - Practice using context managers in your own file handling code.

3. Introduction to JSON:
   - Learn what JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is and why it's a popular data format.
   - Understand how JSON is structured and how it relates to Python data structures like lists and dictionaries.
   - Explore Python's built-in json module and its capabilities.

4. Reading and Writing JSON Data:
   - Discover how to read and write JSON data in Python.
   - Understand how Python objects can be serialized to JSON format and deserialized back into Python objects.
   - Practice handling JSON data through reading and writing exercises.

5. Introduction to CSV:
   - Learn about CSV (Comma-Separated Values), a simple file format used to store tabular data.
   - Understand the structure of CSV files and how they can be manipulated in Python.
   - Explore Python's built-in csv module and its features.

6. Reading and Writing CSV Data:
   - Discover how to read and write CSV data in Python.
   - Understand how CSV data can be transformed into Python objects for manipulation and processing.
   - Practice handling CSV data with Python through reading and writing exercises.

Throughout this module, you'll reinforce your understanding with hands-on exercises and programming challenges. These activities will enhance your understanding of file I/O operations and their use in Python programming. By the end of the module, you'll have the skills to efficiently read from and write to text, JSON, and CSV files using Python.

Remember to strive for clean and efficient code, and to challenge yourself by solving diverse programming problems involving file I/O. Developing a strong foundation in file handling will enable you to handle more complex tasks, such as data analysis and web development. Get ready for an exciting journey into the world of file handling in Python!
