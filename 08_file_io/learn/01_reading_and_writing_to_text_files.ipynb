    "# Reading and Writing to Text Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the exciting world of file I/O operations in Python! In this tutorial, we're going to explore the basic process of opening, reading, writing, and closing text files. By the end of this tutorial, you will not only understand these fundamental operations but also get hands-on experience with reading from and writing to files in Python. So, let's dive in!\n",

    "## Understanding the File I/O Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of interacting with files in Python follows these basic steps:\n",
    "1. **Open the file:** This creates a file object that you'll use to interact with the file.\n",
    "2. **Read or write to the file:** With the file object, you can read data from the file or write data to it.\n",
    "3. **Close the file:** After you're done with the file, it's important to close it to free up the resources that were tied to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break these steps down and see how they work in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the built-in `open()` function to open a file. This function takes two parameters: the name of the file (including its path, if it's not in the same directory as your Python script) and the mode in which to open the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mode signifies how you plan to interact with the file. Here are some common modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'r'`: Open for reading (default)\n",
    "- `'w'`: Open for writing, clearing the file first\n",
    "- `'a'`: Open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists\n",
    "- `'b'`: Binary mode\n",
    "- `'+'`: Open for updating (reading and writing)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine modes like `'rb'` (read in binary), `'w'` (write in text), `'a+'` (read and write, append if file exists), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's open a file named `my_file.txt` in write mode:\n"
