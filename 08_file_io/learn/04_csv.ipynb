    "CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values. It's a straightforward file format used to store tabular data, like a spreadsheet or a database. Each line in a CSV file represents a row in the table, and each field in that row (column in the table) is separated by a comma, hence the name.\n"

Make sure to check out the official Python documentation on the `csv` module for more details and keep practicing with different CSV files to solidify your understanding.\n",
