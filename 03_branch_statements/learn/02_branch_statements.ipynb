    "## If Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The if statement is used to perform different actions based on different\n",
    "conditions. It allows us to execute a block of code only if a certain condition\n",
    "is satisfied. The if statement is typically followed by one or more elif (short\n",
    "for \"else if\") statements and optionally an else statement. These additional\n",
    "statements provide alternative conditions to check when the original condition\n",
    "is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by understanding the basic syntax of the if statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `condition` is an logical expression that evaluates to either `True` or\n",
    "`False`. If the condition is `True`, the indented code block following the colon\n",
    "(`:`) will be executed. If the condition is `False`, the code block will be\n",
    "skipped, and the program moves on to the next statement. The code block may\n",
    "contain multiple lines of code and have nested code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what's with the colon (`:`) and indentation? In Python, the colon is used to\n",
    "indicate the start of a new block of code. It acts as a separator between the\n",
    "condition and the code block. The indented code block following the colon is\n",
    "known as the \"body\" of the if statement. The indentation (usually four spaces or\n",
    "a tab) is crucial in Python because it determines which lines of code are part\n",
    "of the block. \n",
