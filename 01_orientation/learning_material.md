# Orientation

In this module, you will gain a solid foundation in Python development by
learning key concepts related to accessing your workspace, creating Python
files, and running them. This module is designed to provide an orientation to
the Python development environment and equip you with the necessary skills to
start writing and executing Python code effectively. 

 ## Module Topics:

1. Accessing Your Workspace:
   - Understand the importance of organizing your development environment.
   - Learn how to navigate and access your workspace in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
   - Explore the benefits of organizing files and directories for efficient Python development.

2. Creating a Python File:
   - Gain insights into the structure and format of a Python file.
   - Learn how to create a new Python file using a text editor or IDE.
   - Understand the importance of file naming conventions and the .py file extension.
   - Explore best practices for organizing code within a Python file.

3. Running a Python File:
   - Discover different methods to execute a Python file.
   - Explore the use of integrated development environment (IDE) features for running code.
   - Learn how to run a Python file from the command line interface (CLI).
   - Understand how to interpret and handle the output generated by a Python program.

Throughout this module, you will have the opportunity to gain hands-on
experience in creating Python files and executing them. By practicing these
fundamental skills, you will build confidence in your ability to navigate the
Python development environment, organize your workspace effectively, and execute
Python code successfully. 

As you progress through this module, remember to engage actively with the
provided exercises and projects, as they will reinforce your understanding and
help you apply the learned concepts in practical scenarios. By the end of the
module, you will be equipped with the essential knowledge and skills needed to
embark on your Python programming journey with confidence. 

## What to work on?

1. Start by working through the [ReadMe.ipynb](../../ReadMe.ipynb) file in the
   root directory of your Workspace IDE. It will help you understand how jupyter
   notebooks work.

2. Watch the `Intro to Grader Than` video in the Technologies and Support
   section of the LMS. 

3. Create and run your own python file by following directions in the video
   above or in the
   [create_and_run.ipynb](./learn/01_create_and_run.ipynb)

4. Learn how to use the python turtle package by following
   [turtle.ipynb](./learn/02_turtle.ipynb) notebook.
   
5. Submit the orientation assignment on Grader Than.
